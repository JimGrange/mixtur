# mixtur <a ><img src='images/logo/mixtur_logo.png' align="right" height="250" /></a>

**mixtur** is an R package for designing, analysing, and modelling
continuous report visual short-term memory studies. The package allows
users to implement the 2-component (Zhang & Luck, 2008) and 3-component
(Bays, Catalao, & Husain, 2009) mixture models of continuous-report
visual short-term memory data. The package can also fit & simulate the slots
and slots-plus averaging models of Zhang & Luck.

The package allows users to:

  - Obtain summary statistics of response error and response precision
    of behavioural data
  - Produce publication-ready plots of behavioural data
  - Fit both the 2- and 3-component models to user data
  - Plot the goodness of model fit to user data
  - Simulate artificial data from both models
  - Conduct formal model competition analysis

## Installation

You can install the released version of mixtur from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixtur/index.html) with:

``` r
install.packages("mixtur")
```

The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JimGrange/mixtur")
```

## Pre-print

We have a pre-print showing users how to use the package:

  - Grange, J.A. & Moore, S.B. (under review). *mixtur:
    An R package for designing, analysing, and modelling continuous
    report visual short-term memory studies*.
    <https://psyarxiv.com/n6gqx/>

The pre-print also includes several simulation studies exploring some
properties of the models (including parameter recovery simulations,
model recovery simulations) and provide concrete recommendations to
researchers wishing to use mixture modelling in their own research.
