Description: A set of utility functions for analysing and modelling data from 
    continuous report short-term memory experiments using either the 2-component
    mixture model of Zhang and Luck (2008) <doi:10.1038/nature06860> or the 
    3-component mixture model of Bays et al. (2009) <doi:10.1167/9.10.7>. Users 
    are also able to simulate from these models.
